### Introduction

Our project is dedicated to advancing the field of robotics by enabling our hexapod robot to autonomously navigate using a curve detection system. We employ advanced technologies such as OpenCV, Python, and Raspberry Pi to provide real-time decision-making capabilities for the robot.

### Code Architecture

Our code is organized into various modules that work collaboratively. The main module orchestrates the entire operation, with specialized modules for webcam data handling and image processing. We utilize pixel summation techniques, with extensive support from the OpenCV library, to process the robot's real-time camera feed.

### Camera Integration

In the Camera Integration section, we explain how we integrated the camera into the hexapod robot's body. We detail the necessary commands and configurations, including overcoming the initial hurdle of enabling the camera.

### Lane Curve Analysis

Our Lane Curve Analysis section provides an in-depth understanding of how we analyze the curvature of the lane in real-time. We describe the process of warping the image, identifying key points, and making adjustments to create a straighter image.

### Color Picker Script

This section delves into the critical role of the color picker script in our project. We explain how this script accurately identifies RGB values associated with the lane's color, which serves as a reference point for lane tracking.

### Histogram Analysis

In the Histogram Analysis section, we explore how we use histograms to assess the intensity distribution across images. We describe our approach to calculating the curve value and using this information to guide the robot's movements.

### Challenges and Learning Experiences

Our journey was not without its challenges, and in this section, we share some of the obstacles we encountered and the valuable lessons we learned. Challenges included precise camera calibration, optimizing the curve detection algorithm, and adapting the robot's behavior to different driving scenarios.

### Future Enhancements

The Future Enhancements section outlines our plans for improving the project. This includes making the system more robust under diverse lighting conditions, enhancing the robot's adaptability to different types of lanes, and further developing our autonomous navigation algorithms.
